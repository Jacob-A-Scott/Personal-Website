      "content"  : "Gotta Start SomewhereHello and and welcome to my site! My plan is for all of this to serve as a kind of blog/portfolio/brain-dump that I hope to stick with. I discuss my intentions a bit in my About section, but boils down to wanting to share some of the work that I do between my actual work, graduate courses, and personal reading and research. Austin Kleon says in his book, Show Your Work! that “if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist”.  “If your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist.”  Austin KleonI hope to share snippets of what I know and what I’m continuing to learn within the realm of data science and beyond. And in doing so, I hope to reinforce the knowledge for myself and to improve how I communicate these concepts to a less technical audience. That audience may be no one at all, but that is beside the point. Content here will consist of short writeups on tools and workflows I find interesting, project demos, and potential deviations into whatever may be the then-current object of my fascination.Thanks for reading if you are still here! More to come."
