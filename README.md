# My Static Portfolio Blog Built Using Jekyll
This site was built using Artem Sheludko's theme, Joseph, for Jekyll. I have made tweaks to suit my own purposes and all written content is my own. See below for a demo and deployment instructions for Artem's theme:

### Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.
