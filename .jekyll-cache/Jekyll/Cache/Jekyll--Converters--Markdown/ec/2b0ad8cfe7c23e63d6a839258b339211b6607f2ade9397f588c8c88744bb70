<p>Hello and and welcome to my site! My plan is for all of this to serve as a kind of blog/portfolio/brain-dump that I hope to stick with. I discuss my intentions a bit in my <a href="/about">About</a> section, but boils down to wanting to share some of the work that I do between my <em>actual</em> work, graduate courses, and personal reading and research. Austin Kleon says in his book, <em>Show Your Work!</em> that ‚Äúif your work isn‚Äôt online, it doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù.</p>

<p>I hope to share snippets of what I know and what I‚Äôm continuing to learn within the realm of data science and beyond. And in doing so, I hope to reinforce the knowledge for myself and to improve how I communicate these concepts to a <em>less</em> technical audience. That audience may be no one at all, but that is beside the point. Content here will consist of short writeups on tools and workflows I find interesting, project demos, and potential deviations into whatever may be the then-current object of my fascination.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading if you are still here! More to come.</p>
