# Gotta Start Somewhere
Hello and and welcome to my site! My plan is for all of this to serve as a kind of blog/portfolio/brain-dump that I hope to stick with. I discuss my intentions a bit in my [About]({{site.baseurl}}/about) section, but it boils down to wanting to share some of the work that I do between my _actual_ work, graduate courses, and personal reading and research. Austin Kleon says in his book, _Show Your Work!_ that "if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist".

I hope to share snippets of what I know and what I'm continuing to learn within the realm of data science and beyond. And in doing so, I hope to reinforce the knowledge for myself and to improve how I communicate these concepts to a _less_ technical audience. That audience may be no one at all, but that is beside the point. Content here will consist of short writeups on tools and workflows I find interesting, project demos, and potential deviations into whatever may be the then-current object of my fascination.

Thanks for reading if you are still here! More to come.
